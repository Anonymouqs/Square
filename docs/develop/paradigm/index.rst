Coding Paradigm
===============
Since gdscript is unable to have static classes,
there are two main branches of the structure.
The reference classes create a base structure that is referred by
more refined subclasses.

The paradigm that is descibed below is called the **"RR Paradigm"**

The main difference between reference classes and refined classes is
that the **Reference Classes** are stored in a global script folder while
 **Refined classes** are stored in the folder for a specific kind of scene.

For example:
::
  res://scripts/classes/Root.gd
Is a **reference class**
::
  res://scenes/map/door/Door.gd
Is a **refined class**

The purpose of reference class is to allow easire changes and refactoring
of the class structure without having to change every extends.


Defined in 4 main classes in Root.gd:
**Entity** - Characters
**GUI** - UI stuff
**Map** - Mechanics
**Manage** - Manager Classes


Entity
~~~~~~~
Entity is the class that deals with
characters, there are two main subclasses:
**PC** - Which are characters controlled by players
**NPC** - Charactrs that are controlled by the game.

File Structure Paradigm
=======================
As recommended by Godot, specific scripts are stored with their
respective scenes; however, the class tree is stored in a script folder.
